## Project Explanation

![Atrrition DashBoard](https://github.com/TejasPosupo/Data_Analytics_Projects/blob/PowerBi_Projects/Road%20Accident%20Analysis/road.gif)

The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is a technology that gives a visual representation of road accident data, allowing users to rapidly 
and simply analyse and comprehend information. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the number of accidents, kinds of accidents, deaths,
 injuries, and property damage are frequently shown on the dashboard.

The dashboard may additionally give specific information about the incidents, such as the location, date, and time of the collision, as well as 
weather conditions, road surface, and contributing variables. The data may be shown in a variety of ways, including charts, tables, and graphs, 
and it can be filtered by a variety of parameters, including date range, location, and kind of accident.

The dashboard's goal is to give actionable insights that may be utilised to improve traffic safety. By analysing the data, for example,
Traffic authorities and law enforcement organisations, for example, can identify high-risk regions and take action to enhance road infrastructure,
 establish new traffic laws, or expand awareness campaigns.
 
Furthermore, the dashboard can assist policymakers and researchers in understanding the patterns and trends in traffic accidents and developing
evidence-based policies and interventions. The data may also be utilised to educate and create awareness about road safety among the general
population.
 
Analysis of Traffic Accidents Dashboards are useful tools for enhancing road safety because they provide complete and actionable information 
that may be utilised to avoid accidents, save lives, and decrease injuries and property damage.
